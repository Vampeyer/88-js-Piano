--- My name is also Jacob R. Thompson so i will be calling this the 
 Thompson Audio Mapping Format  , 
or the Thompson - " your name here "  Audio format ,  
I dont care ,  and
as I am looking for possible input from others and hopefully collaboration , just in voting on the matters. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello there  , this is Vampeyer. Good afternoon. 
I am building a piano in JS , and I wanted to be as musically accurate as possible to do things 
like write and read music and maybe even create some standards and layouts , to build  Ai audio in the future  that could do things like , 


- Read a standardized  music sheet of 88 - standard keys 

- Properly write these keys , to an agreed upon file format (JSON) , 
              and set up a structure for giving them ID's of sorts , to reference, in data. 

- Implement proper CRUD operations for files and sheets for composition
 and composition tools. ( That's Create Read , Update and Delete operations , the basic building blocks.  )  

- And Therefore,  in the future we would even then have the ability too do  more things like , 

- Convert a song, or a said audio file  into a different  classical musical
 instrument. 

 - Translate and convert a song, or a said audio file  into a different  classical musical
 instruments to play them for a particular piece of said music , 
and even be able to do it 
- Autonomously.  


- Does that sound like something that may be interesting too you ? 


If so  , 
 
..... Lets begin then shall we ? 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- the first step is for us to both acquire and standardize a type of music sheet , to see what we are working with. 
so that we can map it to the keyboard 


- Luckily , My starter repo had a great detail of the 88 standard keys on a keyboard


I have done my research and , the 
Classical Piano Keyboard Structure  does, contain
 -  88   keys  
ref(1)-https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/instruments/piano/why-pianos-have-88-keys/
ref(2)-https://musicsynthlab.com/keyboard-technology-and-features/exploring-digital-piano-sizes-88-key-vs-73-key-vs-61-key/

----------- 
The second reference above , speaks of other numbers of keys and modifications for 
other sizes.  -- Now , due to the fact that me and the rest of the professional community , 
finds beings able to compose full pieces to be a requirement. Therefore , we will be suggesting 
the 88- key standard for portability puroposes. 


Here is another  , 
virtual piano keyboard structure  - for the A23 virtual piano - 
@ - https://recursivearts.com/virtual-piano/
 - this working unity model for a piano contains 
 - 36 regular keys , plus 25 sharpened keys , 
equaling to 61 keys , as a 61-key standard. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now , what to do next  ?  - we have a working example here , on the working unity model for some basic 
keyboard following structures. 

https://recursivearts.com/virtual-piano/   ( Same URL as above )  

 -- On the piano there , you may see s key switch available for both 
Real and Full modes.   That of which are both attempts at
mapping keys to the keyboard.  
using a medium , more minimal  set of keys for a basic layout.  starting with 1 
and ending with > or something.  

and then a full set with the same range but htings like shift + 1 and shift + 2 for seperate note keytones. 
- On a full 61 keyboard layout. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Again , one more time , if you are not sure of what   I am describing above , you may visit that URL on a 
computer , and when using the virtual keyboard , you can adjust those real and full settings there to see 
again , a potential layout structure for the keyboard , of all in which maps 61 keys ,  

----- And as a professional grade developer , I must say , that is a mapping implementation 
that simply must be updated and standardized , 
+for the betterment of reading and writing data n a musical composition. 

+ for the betterment of actual keyboard usage and not around the further complication of playing 
different notes inplaces that cause lessened functionality. 

I say this a good shot in the Development  /  musical and audio realm , although 
it really requires standardization for an adoption. 

I say that this is a standardization that should be made for the betterment of the development 
community , and professional producers as well in any fashion. 

I say that some easy standard mapping method for use on the KEYBOARD is what we need first. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Okay here we go , so this is my proposal for a new 
88-standard notes - to -  keyboard mapping architecture    
( Which, we can talk about modifying it as well as long as you give me credit too !
 - The point of this is that we come up with a method together that is BEST usable .   )




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New - Keyboard proposal structure for the mapping of 
the 88 standard keys , More Structurally useful if and when -  based off of the keyboard. 

 - Finding that there are not enough 
keys on the keyboard to make 88 keys , but there are enough keys to make 44 , 

I will be mapping them to keys , twice , once for 44 mapped keys on a top set 
and 44 keys on a bottom set. 

- doing this method is superior because all of the keys can be much more easily 
accessed as well as then , even there could even be a USB upgrade for two keyboards , 
 -- As to which if one wanted to map all 88 of the keys simultaniously, this could be possible with a hardware
driver upgrade.

- This is also a superior method because it can then standardize the proces as to where ,engineers could 
actually just take two keyboards and then turn them into any type of muscial instrument. 

- Then thereby , being able to create an elegant orchestra of sound and audio by first, 
   accomplishing  a few key features such as , 

  - Being able to quickly and easily reach the standard 88- keys at a time on a with a single keyboard , with a full 
  	44 key , high and low style switch over. ( As too keep playing in sync as well.  )
            
  -Being able to reach all  of the standard 88- at once on two keyboards, if the keye were then mapped 
		on the application layer properly.
