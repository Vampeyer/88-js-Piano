REBUILD NOTES by Vampeyer - 06 - 09

-- Piano in Javascript App. ------------------

Anyhow , yes I am making a
partly paid for ,  freemium application out of this, because devs like to eat food as well.
Period.  So please consider how cool it is too play a piano on a digital devie !  
an do consider funding what you find useful here as well, for your own benefit.  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- to start  - 

Now , 1. I have the audio files from the repo now , 

2. I am now looking at the piano scale , and I am going to attempt to arrange them in some order. 
- Okay so , this is whats happening here for now -  because  uhh  
, well I am a tech genius and well just for now just because I said so just because it works, this is what we 
are doing here but just here just for now  -as a temporary formatting , okey ? . - Ok .


- The piano does NOT go in the order like A2,A1,A,a1,a2,a,B2,B1,B,b2,b1,b etc , it goes like it does in the picture that 
Liam had on here before. 
( That guy made some GREAT documentation btw , someone thank him please.  )  
 ---- Or in perfect ascending aphabetical order like the computer has it, 

So  the real and correct piano scaling order goes like ,  A2 , B2, C1, E1, etc ( refer to the
 picture in the folder named Piano Keyboard.png or 
a regular correct piano scale, online or something  for  reference.  ) 

Since the computer names everything in alphabetical order by default , I am just going to prepend a number before each one 
in correct order , so that they then will be arranged in order. 
- A little trick I am used to doing with files. 

So , in the playing-soiund-samples , they will now al lbe 
just prepended with a number and a - like  
1-A2 , 2-B2, 3-C1 , 4-D1  , to arrange them in such a concurrent and proper manner
as well as prepend my data, in the file  in order for my application when I go to handle it there .
