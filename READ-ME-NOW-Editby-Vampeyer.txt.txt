Hello , My name is Jacob Thompson , 
and I go by the dev name Vampeyer. 

Today is 09/02/2024/ and I am creating a piano app in JavaScript. 

Why ? , 

Because pianos and classical instruments are, 
a testament to the greatness and beauty of both humanity and physical objects , 
to attribute to orchastrated sounds and widely loved compesed pieces alike. 

Because classical instruments are a cornerstone of real class , and thats just that !  
As well as a great and fun starting tool , pianos are  as well as  a scientest and engineers best friend.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And everybody loves them still today !  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So here we go , Piano in JavaScript. 



I first needed to figure out the steps and come around to implementing them - just figuring out the steps, 
because that is how a developer works. So it took me a while until I knew I needed the audio and stuff and actually found the correct
noted piano audio I was looking for. 

- I found some of this repository online ,  so  Iam leaving the details to the original creator there, 
Because thats the correct way to do things , you must always give credit where it is due. 

a Mr. Liam Lee , who has nicely compiled the audio sample, 
from MuseScore and the screenshots to perfectly accompany the notes within. Please consider
donating to him , as any of the money I make off of this application , I will be sharing the profits with 
those who helped me.  

Anyhow , yes I am making a
partly paid for ,  freemium application out of this, because devs like to eat food as well.
Period.  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now , 1. I have the audio files from the repo now , 

2. I am now looking at the piano scale , and I am going to attempt to arrange them in some order.
